Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at the end).

## Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

The submitted code should adhere to the following:

### Do's

* For every pull request, make sure all commits are consolidated into one commit before
  sending the pull request.
* Before submitting any code changes, please ensure that the [Unit Tests](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/tree/master/Tests/UnitTests)
  and [Functional Tests](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/tree/master/Tests/FunctionalTests)
  projects build and all tests pass. If you believe that the test failures are due to bugs in the
  framework then please [file an issue](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/issues).
* If a pull request looks good then we'll wait for Travis to run all the Unit and
  Functional tests on the changes. We also trigger an internal build to check for
  further build breakages. In case any of the tests are broken, we will let you know.
* If your pull request does not touch any code, then you could skip the Travis Continuous
  Integration check by adding [[ci skip]](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Skipping-a-build)
  to your git commit message. This helps prevent over-encumbering the CI.
* Please use [Github's Markdown Formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)
  for formatting your comments and issues.
* Refer to the [Google Objective-C style guide][objc_style] and
  [raywenderlich Swift style guide][swift_style] for our code conventions.

[objc_style]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml
[swift_style]: https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide

### Don'ts

* Consider not adding LGTM's or +1's unless you're specifically asked to do so, since they
  add noise to the conversation.
* Refrain from providing small and granular pull requests for changes that could easily be
  consolidated into one.
* A vague description for a pull request adds to the review time because we now have to analyze
  what the code does. A more descriptive description will help the reviewers understand what
  they're reviewing.

## Github Issues

### Do's

* Ensure you've searched extensively through the documentation before filing a Github Issue. As
  a developer, please provide us issue descriptions that you yourself would like to read.
* Please be as verbose in your comments and descriptions as possible. For each issue, add in the
  type of project, language used, Xcode version, error trace etc. While we love the fact that
  you're helping us improve the project, it would be nice for us not to have to ask for debugging
  clarifications for every issue created.
* For in-depth discussions please use the [EarlGrey Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/earlgrey-discuss)
  instead of starting a Github Issue.

### Don'ts

* Any vaguely worded issue will be immediately closed. If there is inactivity on an issue for
  an extended period of time, it will also be closed.

## The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
